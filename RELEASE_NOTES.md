## v1.13.0 — Cross-Session Dictionary Caching

Changes since v1.12.0:

### Compression & Caching
- **Cross-Session Dictionary Caching**: Persists `dynamicDict` and `fileIndex` on disk under `~/.glyphcompress/cache/<sha256>.json` to enable instant warm-starts.
- **Consistent Compression Keying**: Uses SHA-256 hashes of workspace paths (for VS Code extension) and working directories (for CLI/proxy) to ensure robust, isolated, project-specific caches.
- **Improved Anthropic Prompt Caching**: Prompts remain consistent across separate developer sessions, avoiding unnecessary cache invalidation and reducing input token costs.
- **Dynamic Restorations**: Restores dynamic dictionary mappings and bigram counts seamlessly on startup, ensuring compression consistency across multiple command-line invocations and extension reloads.

### Infrastructure & Compatibility
- **ESM & CJS Exporter Synchronization**: Resolved exports mismatch by exposing `PROVIDER_COMPRESSION_PROFILES` and `TRUST_POLICY_PROFILES` consistently in the CommonJS build (`vscode-ext/glyph-middleware.cjs`).
- **Build and Compilation Tooling**: Introduced an automated ESM-to-CJS compilation pipeline using `esbuild` with a post-build token-estimator path rewritings.

### Docs & Roadmaps
- **Roadmap & README Syncing**: Updated `ROADMAP.md` and `README.md` to reflect complete `v1.13.0` caching goals.
- **Wiki Synchronization**: Updated offline and online Wiki pages covering the cache directory, release procedures, and technical setup.

### Tests
- **Caching Coverage**: Added comprehensive unit tests in `test/unit.js` checking that compressor warm-starts correctly restore serialized dynamic dictionaries and file indices.
- **Suite Verification**: 51/51 tests passing across metadata, snapshots, unit, cli, workspace, proxy, and integration test suites.

### Validation
- `npm test` (51/51 integration, unit, metadata pass)
- `npm run check:links`
- `npm run build:middleware`
- `npm run package:vscode`
